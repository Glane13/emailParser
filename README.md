# emailParser
[Demonstrating use of Python for a text processing utility program]

I wrote this program as a utility for my own benefit in March 2018. I used Python in order practice that language.

I was helping a small voluntary organisation. The organisation received certain emails in a standard format asking to join a mailing list or to subscribe to other activities. The primary purpose of the program was to process these emails and add them to a spreadsheet. The speadsheet could then be used to add subscribers to MailChimp mailing lists or to add a table to a the website.

The emails could be in English or in French and the program can handle both. Certain of the French accented characters caused problems in the operation of the program so the code has been written to deal with this issue.
